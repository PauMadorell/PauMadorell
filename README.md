## Hobbies  

#### I like to spend my free time doing different activities, suchs as playing videogames (I think I don't need to explain why). My favourite genre are strategy, open world and shooters. I also like drawing and sometimes I have the need of playing the piano which I don't know how to but there's nothing wrong with trying.
